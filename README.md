# Tracker-using-MediaPipe

This project demonstrates **real-time hand tracking** using [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
It includes two simple but powerful applications:

* **Finger Counter** – Detects the number of fingers raised.
* **Hands Up Counter** – Detects how many hands are raised in the camera feed.

---

## ✨ Features

* Real-time hand detection with MediaPipe.
* Finger counting using landmark positions.
* Detecting how many hands are up at once.
* Simple, lightweight, and easy-to-understand code.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **OpenCV** – for image/video processing.
* **MediaPipe** – for hand tracking.
